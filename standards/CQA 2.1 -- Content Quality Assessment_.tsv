Tip: unhide assessment proposal columns to facilitate asynchronous reviews by multiple associates. (Double click the arrows between columns B and F.) When everybody has finished and an agreement is reached, put the result in the Assessment field (column F).

Vale instructions							
							
The CQA includes using required vale tools to identify and fix asciidoc content so that it can be migrated.  Complete the following steps:							
1. Time saver! Run the Asciidoc Content Type Editor and fix any errors.							
    Fixing content type issues before running the asciidoctor-data-vale tool fixes a lot of potential errors. 							
2. Run the Vale asciidoctor-dita-vale tool check and address any errors and warnings. (See row 37)							
     See the ToolX migration tool page for more information. 							
       Tip: Use the Vale CLI to scan many files at once. Use the Vale VS Code extension to find the issues in the files.							
3. Complete the rest of the items (rows 33 and following) on the Pre-migration tab.							
4. Continue to use the Vale VS Code extension to lint your content as you continue to work before migration so that you don't add migration issues.

Assemblies should contain only an introductory section, which can be one or more paragraphs, and include statements. You can also have an Additional resources section at the end of the assembly, after all of the includes. DITA maps do not accept text between include statements for modules.
